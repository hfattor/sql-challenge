# sql-challenge
This respository examines information about employees hired at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. Code to assess specific questions about employees, their jobs, their salaries, their name relationships, their hiring dates, etc. is coded in .sql. 

## Data Modeling
Table relationships for the database are mapped into a 3NF entity relationship diagram (ERD) in the .png file labelled ERD_employeedata.png. The data in these 6 tables is found in the data folder. Data is in .csv file format.

## Data Engineering
The .sql code to import the CSV files into a SQL database is stored in the creating_tables.sql file. This code establishes the tables in the order they should be created. It codes primary and secondary keys that correspond to information in each of the 6 .csv files in the data folder. The tables are named according to the corresponding .csv files, for ease of importing the correct data into the correct file. 

The following tables hold the following information.

<strong>departments</strong>
<ul>
  <li>dept_no - Department ID number (5 characters long), primary key</li>
  <li>dept_name - Name of the department (varchar/string)</li>
</ul>

<strong>titles</strong>
<ul>
  <li>title_id - Employee job ID number (5 characters long), primary key</li>
  <li>title - Employee job title (varchar/string)</li>
</ul>

<strong>employees</strong>
<ul>
  <li>emp_no - Employee ID number (5 characters long), primary key</li>
  <li>emp_title - Employee job ID number (5 characters long), foreign key</li>
  <li>birth_date - Date of employee's birth (date)</li>
  <li>first_name - Employee first name (varchar/string)</li>
  <li>last_name - Employee last name (varchar/string)</li>
  <li>sex - Employee sex (5 characters long)</li>
  <li>hire_date - Date of employee's hiring at Pewlett Hackard (date)</li>
</ul>

<strong>dept_employees/Department Employees</strong>
<ul>
  <li>emp_no - Employee ID number (5 characters long), foreign key</li>

</ul>

<strong>dept_manager/Department Managers</strong>
<ul>
  <li>dept_no - Department ID number (5 characters long), foreign key</li>

</ul>

Please review the ERD .png file in the repository for more detail about the table relationships.
